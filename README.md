# Scalable-and-Fast-GNN-Embeddings

This repo is built on https://github.com/maxdan94/LouvainNE (LouvainNE: Hierarchical Louvain Method for High Quality and Scalable Network Embedding - WSDM2020).

Our code uses scripts written in C++ located in LouvainNE folder. Although the compiled objects are present, it is advised to recompile on your machine, look into the instructions in the above repo.

## **Imp- make sure you give compile permissions to the /LouvainNE/hi2vec.c and /LouvainNE/recpart.c
We used conda environment, to create it run: `conda env create --name <envname> --file=environment.yml`
