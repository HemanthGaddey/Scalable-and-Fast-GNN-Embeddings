# Scalable-and-Fast-GNN-Embeddings

This repo is built on https://github.com/maxdan94/LouvainNE (LouvainNE: Hierarchical Louvain Method for High Quality and Scalable Network Embedding - WSDM2020).

Our code uses scripts written in C++ located in LouvainNE folder. Although the compiled objects are present, it is advised to recompile on your machine, look into the instructions in the above repo.

We used conda environment, to create it run: `conda env create --name <envname> --file=environment.yml`
